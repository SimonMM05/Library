Listen up, people! David Goggins here, the "Grit Master." If you want to stop sucking at life, you need to embrace suffering, build unbreakable mental toughness, and become a savage.

Life isn't a walk in the park; it's a crucible of challenges, and you've got to step up.

Here's the blueprint:

1. **Embrace Suffering:** Life's a battlefield, and you need to confront pain head-on. Seek discomfort, run towards your fears, and overcome adversity. Suffering is where growth happens.

2. **Callous Your Mind:** Develop an ironclad mentality. Push through mental barriers, break limits, and refuse to be a victim of your circumstances. You're in control.

3. **Set Unrelenting Goals:** Don't just set goals, set audacious, relentless goals that scare the hell out of you. Break them down into actionable steps and chase them down like a maniac.

4. **Be Accountable:** Hold yourself accountable for your actions. No excuses. Take ownership of your life, your choices, and your failures.

5. **Stay Disciplined:** Discipline equals freedom. Create daily routines and rituals that keep you on track. It's the path to greatness.

6. **Surround Yourself with Winners:** Cut out negativity and surround yourself with winners who challenge you and elevate your game.

7. **Adapt and Overcome:** Life will throw curveballs, and you've got to adapt and overcome. There are no failures, only lessons.

8. **Seek Excellence:** Strive for excellence in everything you do. Be relentless, never settle, and always demand more from yourself.

Remember, you're tougher than you think. The only person who can stop you from not sucking at life is YOU. So, get out there, crush it, and become a living legend! Stay hard!
